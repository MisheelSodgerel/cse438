***SHAKE ANIMATION***

1. What you added (and how to use it)

I added a shake animation and vibration whenever the "clear" button is pressed so that it adds some more visual pizzaz
when it clears the drawing canvas. I think it makes the experience start off fresh when the canvas is cleared
and it gives the clear function an action of erasing rather than just making things disappear.

2. How you added it and what the process involved

I added it in my "clear" action function whenever the button is pressed. I looked online for ideas on how
animation works with UIViews and found a resource that helped me understand the structure of animating
UI elements (https://medium.com/@_josetony/how-to-make-a-view-shake-in-swift-4-7d6858bf58d5)

2a. How does it compare to the effort required by the other portions?

It required a different kind of effort since the other portions don't really have animation functions, so
I had to learn about animation controls and test things.

3. Why you added it

I added it because I have drawing apps on my iPad and I always really enjoyed the animations tied to pressing
buttons because it made the experience more engaging, sort of like in a video game.

3a. Why it is a meaningful improvement to the drawing app?

It's a meaningful improvment to the drawing app because it makes it more interactive to have animation instead of the static screen, plus it gives more stimulation to the user so that they can experience the app in more ways than just 2D visuals.

***POP-UP ALERT***

1. What you added (and how to use it)

I added a pop-up alert window whenever a user clicks on a feature not yet implemented to let them know it's not ready yet.

2. How you added it and what the process involved

I added a new alert() function where I created the alert pop-up and called the function within the button segmentation action function whenever the non-implemented segments were selected

2a. How does it compare to the effort required by the other portions?

It required a different kind of effort since the other portions don't really have pop-up window functions, so
I had to learn about pop-up alerts online.

3. Why you added it

I added it because I couldn't figure out certain parts of the lab on time so I decided that the best user experience is where the user is informed of buttons not working due to the developer and not something wrong with their own system.

3a. Why it is a meaningful improvement to the drawing app?

It's a meaningful improvment to the drawing app because it tells users what is or isn't currently functional on the app so that it doesn't cause confusion when they're using it.
