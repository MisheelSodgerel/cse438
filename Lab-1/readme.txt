1. What you implemented 
  I implemented a simple shopping calculator where the user can input their budget, original price, discount percent, and sales percent with a decimal pad. 
  the calculator then provides the final price dynamically as the info is added. The creative portion adds the budget aspect where users can input their budget
  and as they're calculating the final price, it calculates and tells them if they're over/under their budget. I also added French as a localized language.
  
2. How you implemented it 
  I implemented it by making my text fields into both outlets and actions (on value changed), calculating the final cost within each function, and set the label text to the final price. 
  I added on the budget calculations to these functions as well. I added the localization files and used Google Translate to translate the Enlish to French.
  
3. Why you implemented it 
  I implemented it because I thought this format would be the most straight forward and intuitive for the assigned goal.
